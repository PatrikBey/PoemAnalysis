# Poem_analysis


A small MATLAB Toolbox for analysis of poems and short stories with respect to word distributions and semantics. Created for usage within the Chair of Neurocognitive Pychology of Prof. Abraham at Freie Universit√§t Berlin.

These scripts are not maintained and functionality was ensured only for given test examples of a compilation of Shakespeare sonets.
